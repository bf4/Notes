notes:
he -r switch requires an argument which is the URL of the media server and is found in the variable streamer in the JavaScript source code above.

The -y switch needs the playpath and that is found in the JavaScript variable file, (minus the extension .flv or .mp4).

The -a switch is the name of the used player and usually automatically inferred from the URL. Defining it manually works by copying the part after the server name in the streamer.

The -s switch defines the flash video player which normally connects to the media server. In the example it is the first argument of the function embedSWF.

Here's where things get even more complicated. The media server wants some extra data about this player, specifically its sha256 hash-sum and size in bytes. So lets get them:
Code:
    wget http://media.videolectures.net/jw-player/player.swf
    sha256sum player.swf
    ls -l player.swf
Supply the sha256sum to switch -w and the file size to the -x switch.

Download the swf player you want to use for SWFVerification, unzip it using

$ flasm -x file.swf

It will show the decompressed filesize, use it for --swfsize

Now generate the hash

$ openssl sha -sha256 -hmac "Genuine Adobe Flash Player 001" file.swf

and use the --swfhash "01234..." option to pass it.

e.g. $ ./rtmpdump --swfhash "123456..." --swfsize 987.
