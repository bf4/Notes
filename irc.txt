Channel operator commands
Various IRC clients have different commands. Most of the commands in this list should work on all popular IRC clients, but there may be additional commands available or alternate syntax for these commands. If there are multiple commands listed and one command fails to work, try using another to accomplish the same result. Consult your IRC client's manuals, help files, or a general IRC reference for more information about these commands and other command interfaces.

/kick #wikimedia jwales
/kick jwales To ban a user*
/mode #wikimedia +b nick!user@host To quickly kick and ban a user **
/kickban jwales To silence a user
/mode #wikimedia +q nick!user@host To lock the topic***
/mode #wikimedia +t

/mode #wikimedia +m

*Banning a user only prevents their entry. They must be kicked separately. ** Depending on your client, the ban may be set on the user's nickname, host, or username+host combination. You may be able to adjust this. (For example, in irssi, /set ban_type host.) Consult your IRC client's documentation. ***Locking the topic prevent non-ops from changing it (useful if a topic war is ongoing) ****In a moderated channel, no one can talk unless they are an operator or are voiced (mode +v). This is usually an extreme measure, since it prevents people from using the channel. Use with discretion.
